# Cytube DOM Context Pack

These files are **reference snapshots** of the live Cytube page DOM. They exist to give Codex (and humans) stable context for writing UI code that interacts with page HTML not stored in the repo.

## What’s inside

- `*-reference.html`: minimal, cleaned structural snapshots (not the full page)
- `dom-map-*.md`: selector guides + practical patterns

## How to use

In prompts, tell Codex:
“Use `docs/cytube-dom/*reference.html` and `docs/cytube-dom/dom-map-*.md` as the DOM source of truth.”
